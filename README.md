***This repo is the other half to a coding challenge I did for an interview.  React is used with a google maps component.  Data is served via a Django backend (https://github.com/jonparkdev/back-end-realestateapp/blob/master/README.md). Data is served to a Redux store.  Google maps component takes data in redux store and populates marker components onto map.*** 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

***The google map api only allows one API call per day for non-paying users***
